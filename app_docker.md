This walks through setting up a django docker app.

# Set up
Create the superuser via a migration
```
python manage.py makemigrations --empty yourappname
```
Then edit it. In the below, replace the dependency line with the migration before yours. 
```python
# Generated by Django 5.0.4 on 2024-06-19 19:41

import logging
import os
from django.db import migrations
from dotenv import load_dotenv

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def generate_superuser(apps, schema_editor):
    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

    USERNAME = os.environ.get("DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME", "portfolio_django_superuser")
    PASSWORD = os.environ.get("DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD")
    EMAIL = os.environ.get("DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL")

    user = get_user_model()

    if not user.objects.filter(username=USERNAME, email=EMAIL).exists():
        logger.info("Creating new superuser")
        admin = user.objects.create_superuser(
           username=USERNAME, password=PASSWORD, email=EMAIL
        )
        admin.save()
    else:
        logger.info("Superuser already created!")


class Migration(migrations.Migration):
   dependencies = [("home", "0003_homepage_body")]

   operations = [migrations.RunPython(generate_superuser)]
```


# Dockerfile
In the main directory, add a `Dockerfile`

Example: 
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime (https://hub.docker.com/_/python) based on Debian as a parent image.
FROM python:3.11.9-slim-bookworm

# Add user that will be used in the container.
RUN useradd wagtail

# Port used by this container to serve HTTP.
EXPOSE 8000

# Set environment variables.
# 1. Force Python stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered.
# 2. Set PORT variable that is used by Gunicorn. This should match "EXPOSE"
#    command.
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PORT=8000\
    DB_NAME=portfolio\
    DB_USER=portfolio_user\
    DB_HOST=portfoliodb

# Install system packages required by Wagtail and Django.
RUN apt-get update --yes --quiet && apt-get install --yes --quiet --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    libpq-dev \
    libmariadbclient-dev \
    libjpeg62-turbo-dev \
    zlib1g-dev \
    libwebp-dev \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install the application server.
RUN pip install "gunicorn==20.0.4"

# Install the project requirements.
COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install -r /requirements.txt

# Use /app folder as a directory where the source code is stored.
WORKDIR /app

# Set this directory to be owned by the "wagtail" user. This Wagtail project
# uses SQLite, the folder needs to be owned by the user that
# will be writing to the database file.
RUN chown wagtail:wagtail /app

# Copy the source code of the project into the container.
COPY --chown=wagtail:wagtail . .

# Use user "wagtail" to run the build commands below and the server itself.
USER wagtail

# Collect static files.
RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --clear



# chmod fails if I don't switch to root
USER root
# Migrate and make super user
ADD docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
# COPY docker-entrypoint.sh .
RUN chmod +x /docker-entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]
USER wagtail

# Runtime command that executes when "docker run" is called, it does the
# following:
#   1. Migrate the database.
#   2. Start the application server.
# WARNING:
#   Migrating database at the same time as starting the server IS NOT THE BEST
#   PRACTICE. The database should be migrated manually or using the release
#   phase facilities of your hosting platform. This is used only so the
#   Wagtail instance can be started with a simple "docker run" command.
#   removed: python manage.py migrate --noinput;
CMD ["set", "-xe", "gunicorn", "portfolio.wsgi:application"]
```

# .env
In the main directory, add a `.env` file.
```env
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=django_superuser
DB_NAME=my_db
DB_USER=my_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=my_db_host
DB_PORT=5432
```

# Add a docker-entrypoint.sh
In the main directory, add a `docker-entrypoint.sh` file.
```sh
#!/bin/sh

python manage.py makemigrations --noinput
python manage.py migrate --noinput
# python manage.py createcachetable --noinput

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

# .dockerignore
In the main directory, add a `.dockerignore` file.

Use a template made for your app, such as python/django. 

# docker-compose.yml
You might consider docker-compose to simplify deployment. Add a `docker-compose.yml` like this
```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  my-postgres:
    image: postgres
    container_name: portfoliodb
    env_file: postgres.env
    ports: 
    - '5432:5432'
    volumes:
    - C:\Docker\pgdev:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  web:
    build: .
    container_name: portfolioapp
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - .:/app # The container will use the current folder as .
    # environment:
    #   - DJANGO_ENV=${DJANGO_ENV}
    depends_on:
      - my-postgres
    # develop:
    #   watch:
    #     - action: sync # Can try just sync or rebuild if needed
    #       path: .
    #       target: /app # ensure user can write to path (--chown)


# volumes:
#   pgdata: C:\Docker\pgdev


# By default Compose sets up a single network for your app. 
# Each container for a service joins the default network 
# and is both reachable by other containers on that network, 
# and discoverable by the service's name.
```

Here are the commands to build and bring up using a specific docker-compose file, you can avoid that if you only have the one. When you need to make migrations, just bring it down and back up. No need to rebuild. 

Build:
```
docker-compose --file docker-compose-dev.yml build
```
Up (optional -d for detached):
```
docker-compose --file docker-compose-dev.yml up
```
