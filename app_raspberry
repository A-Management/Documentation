# Hardening

## Auto Updates
I tried unattended-upgrade but they lock the system so it can't install or shut down for hours.

## Firewall
```
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw limit ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
sudo ufw logging on
sudo ufw enable
```

## Restrict SSH
I tried this as well but ended up not being able to use certificates yet. Still working on it.
